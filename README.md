# Blood Transfusion Reaction Rule-Based NLP

The code within this repo provides a custom-developed regular expression-based natural language processing (NLP) algorithm describe in "Novel Computational Methods on Electronic Health Record Yields New Estimates of Transfusion-Associated Circulatory Overload in Populations Enriched with High-Risk Patients". This NLP alorithm streamlines the extraction of transfusion reactions features including transfusion reaction date, impression, case definition, severity, and imputability documented in the transfusion reaction reports.

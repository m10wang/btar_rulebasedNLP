# Blood Transfusion Reaction Rule-Based NLP

The code within this repo provides a custom-developed regular expression-based natural language processing (NLP) algorithm describe in "Novel Computational Methods on Electronic Health Record Yields New Estimates of Transfusion-Associated Circulatory Overload in Populations Enriched with High-Risk Patients". This NLP alorithm streamlines the extraction of transfusion reactions features including transfusion reaction date, impression, case definition, severity, and imputability documented in the transfusion reaction reports. 


### Abstract of the manuscript
Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO) is a severe adverse reaction (AR) contributing to the leading cause of mortality associated with transfusions. As strategies to mitigate TACO have been increasingly adopted, an update of incidence rates and risk factors associated with TACO using the growing sources of electronic health record (EHR) data can help understand transfusion safety. 

This retrospective study aimed to provide a timely and reproducible assessment of incidence rates and risk factors associated with TACO. Novel NLP methods, now made publicly available on GitHub, were developed to extract ARs from 2,556 transfusion reaction reports. Other patient-level data were extracted computationally from UCSF EHR between 2012 and 2020. Risk factors were calculated using multivariate logistic regression analysis. 

75 TACO cases were identified while 31,488 adult patients received transfusions (total 253,212 units). The incidence of TACO was estimated to be 0.2% per patient (0.03% per unit transfused). Patients with a history of TACO (OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.31-1.65) and the use of fluid managements, loop diuretics (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.31-1.61), dialysis (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.04-2.08), and combination of diuretics (OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.26-2.37), prior to transfusion were associated with increased risk of TACO. 

While TACO can be severe, events remained rare, even in populations enriched with high-risk patients, perhaps due to increased awareness. Novel computational methods can be used to find and continually surveil for transfusion ARs. Results suggest that aggressive fluid management may be one of several strategies warranted in a small minority of patients to mitigate risks of TACO.

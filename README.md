# Blood Transfusion Reaction Rule-Based NLP

The code within this repo provides a custom-developed regular expression-based natural language processing (NLP) algorithm describe in "Transfusion-Associated Circulatory Overload in Populations Enriched with High-Risk Patients". This NLP alorithm streamlines the extraction of transfusion reactions features including transfusion reaction date, impression, case definition, severity, and imputability documented in the transfusion reaction reports.

# Abstract of the manuscript
Background: Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO) is a severe reaction that has been recognized as the leading cause of mortality and morbidity associated with blood transfusions. As awareness and strategies to mitigate TACO have been broadly adopted to improve blood transfusion safety in recent years, an update of incidence rates and potential risk factors associated with TACO are imperative to understand blood transfusion safety.  
Study design and methods: This retrospective study with multivariate logistic regression analysis aimed to provide a timely and reproducible assessment of incidence rates and potential risk factors associated with TACO to improve blood transfusion safety. Novel computational methods were developed to extract patient-level data from Electronic Health Records and 2,556 transfusion reaction reports available at UCSF from 2012 to 2020. 

Results: 75 TACO cases were identified while 31,488 unique adult patients received blood transfusions (total 253,212 units) at UCSF. The incidence of TACO was estimated to be 0.2% per patient (0.03% per unit transfused). Patients with a history of TACO (OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.31-1.65) and the use of fluid management such as loop diuretics (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.31-1.61), dialysis (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.04-2.08), and combination of diuretics (OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.26-2.37) prior to transfusion were associated with increased risk of TACO. 

Discussion: While TACO can be severe, events remained rare, even in populations enriched with high-risk patients. We found that more aggressive fluid management or different strategies may be warranted in a small minority of patients to mitigate risks of developing TACO.
